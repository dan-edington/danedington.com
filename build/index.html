      <h2>Hi, I'm Dan and I'm a developer from Manchester, UK.</h2>
      <p>Building things for the web; that's my thing. I also love using fancy new tech whenever possible.</p>
      <p>I specialise in web technologies including, but not limited to:</p>
      <ul class="mainSkills">
        <li>Javascript (ES6)</li>
        <li>OO & Functional coding paradigms</li>
        <li>React (with Redux)</li>
        <li>Node JS</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>Responsive HTML5 / CSS3 (Sass)</li>
        <li>Webpack / Gulp</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>I'm completely self taught and have worked in the industry for about 15 years.</h2>
      <p>In that time, I have worked on projects for loads of big brands including Coca Cola, PWC, Lexus and The Lad Bible.</p>
      <h2>In 2006, I chose to study graphic design for 2 years...</h2>
      <p>...that's when I realised I was an engineer, not an artist. I work well with designers though!</p>
      <h2>When I'm not working, I like to get musical.</h2>
      <p>Just don't ask me to sing. Guitars and synths are more my thing.</p>
      <h2>I'm also a big fan of gaming.</h2>
      <p>When I'm not playing, you'll find me working on my first ever VR game!</p>
